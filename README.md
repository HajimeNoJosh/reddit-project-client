  Hajimeddit is a site similar to Reddit where users can sign up and
  join a community. Users can create posts and comment on other users
  posts, while simultaneously voting on whether they like the posts or
  comments shared.

I created this application to test my knowledge of React, and to gain insight in how to utilize modals in React. I found throughout  my experience that React is not as scary as I once thought. Props made a lot more sense and I found that I was able to understand them as being similar to HTML attribute tags. I was able to pass props along to components and started to understand the waterfall methodology of React. I really look forward to implementing more design and structure to this application. This application taught me a lot  about best practices when it comes to React and I want to continue to learn!

My future goals is to create a greeting message for users. I would also like to store the state of whether the user has upvoted or downvoted. This was also my first app that I used session/cookies and I want to find out more about this. I am not sure if this application utilizes the session as effectivly as it could. I would also like to know how many upvotes a post/comment has even when signed out.

 On the backend I would hope to clean up the way that it stores upvotes/downvotes. I would  hope to start utilizing the knew knowledge I gained through my exposure to increasing the comments counter for posts.
